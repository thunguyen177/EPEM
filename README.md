This repo contains scripts to reproduce the results in the paper:

"EPEM: Efficient Parameter Estimation for Multiple Class Monotone Missing Data"

The notebooks are created by Google's Colaboratory.

[The "Parameter estimation error" notebook](https://github.com/thunguyen177/EPEM/blob/master/Parameter%20estimation%20error.ipynb) produces the results in *Table 2: Parameters estimation errors with different missing rates*.

[The "application in linear discriminant analysis" notebook](https://github.com/thunguyen177/EPEM/blob/master/application%20in%20linear%20discriminant%20analysis.ipynb)  produces the results in *Table 3: The cross-validation errors on datasets with different missing rates in LDA application*.
